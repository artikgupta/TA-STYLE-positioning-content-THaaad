              In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats?
              barns, and rickyards,our docks, our granaries, our ships, and our
              o mention, how useful they are! In our ships, however, the rats
              oft set them wharves, in our corn markets, meat markets, and other
              places too numerous sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our
              kitchens and storerooms, our farms, at defiance; still they are of
              great service How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for
              rats or mice, awaiting heir egress from their place of refuge or
              that which is their home! How well describes this keen attention
              of the cat to its natural pursuit! The cat, with eyne of burning
              coal, Now crouches from (before) the mouse's hole A slight rustle,
              and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, sharp, resolute motion,and
              the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one have a plague of
              rats and mice, as I once had, and let them be delivered therefrom
              by cats, as I was,and they will have a lasting and kind regard for
              them
            </p>
